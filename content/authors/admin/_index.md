I'm a Researcher and Lecturer in the [Statistics Department][1] of the
Federal University of Paraná ([UFPR][8]), Brazil. I'am a member of the
Laboratory of Statistics and Geoinformation ([LEG][]), where I deal
mainly with statistical spatial models applied to environmental and
ecological problems, specially those dealing with marine fisheries
resources. I'm also a collaborator at the Laboratory of Environmental
Statistics ([LEA][]) of Federal University of Rio Grande ([FURG][]).

In 2019 I received a doctorate degree in [Statistics and Agricultural
Experimentation][] from University of São Paulo ([USP][11]), Brazil.
Originally, I have a bachelor degree in [Oceanography][3] from
University of Vale do Itajaí ([UNIVALI][9]), with a master's degree in
[Ecology][5] from Federal University of Santa Catarina ([UFSC][10]).
